==== how to upload data to databse=======


1. In customuser model and subjects model sem field is in integer
2. First you have to create or upload customuser 
3. Then you have to upload course -> years ->subjects data's


===== how attendance should be stored to database=====

First check if the subject is of which type
1. For normal theory subjects -> store attendance hour on section 


    for eg:- suppose programming in c is a subject name
            then first check if the subject has sections
            if yes then store the based on subjects corresponding section
            if programming in c is of section A 
            then store attendace 
            programming in c | A | Bca 1 | total hour-> 1
            if programming in c is of section B
            then store attendace
            programming in c | B | Bca 1 | total hour ->1

2. For normal lab subjects -> store the attendace hour based on lab_batch

    for eg:- suppose java lab is a lab subjects
    then first check if the subject has lab_batch
            if yes then store the total hour based on the subjects lab_batch type



===== how to right subject code=====

<subject name> <sem> <lab_batch> <section>

sem -> 1,2,3,4,5,6
lab_batch -> 0,1            0-> means normal batch    1->means addon batch
section ->0, A, B           0-> means no section  A-> means section A  B-> means section B


=====subject table =======

lab_batch ->  0 = means no batch , normal= only bca,  =addon= bca + addon

==== session data serialization====

1. now im using pickle to serialize session data -> which is not secure
